  I plan on trying this ethical hacking project for beginners from github.com/0xrajneesh/Ethical-Hacking-Projects-for-beginners but I ran into some problems cause I didn't have multiple devices to test on a local Network I found a way out yesterday but couldn't complete it because of real-life reasons. I will continue today and make sure I get the online LAN ready so I can start with my projects. I'll be using GNS3 as the platform for where I will be running my tests.
  At the end of today, I accomplished a lot in fixing the GNS3. However, I'm still facing many issues, but I'm not backing down at all.

27/Dec/24
  Ok so I plan on finishing fixing the GNS3 today, but I'm going out later today so tomorrow I might be finishing it. So at the end of the day, I didn't accomplish anything. I couldn't even go out today for some reason which is why I have to work harder so I can provide for little things that prevented me from doing some things today

28/Dec/24
  So I want to finish this today, I saw something that might be of great help to me.

31/Dec/24
  Today I couldn't do much because my laptop charger has spoilt, hoping to get a new one after the New Year celebration 

1/Jan/25
  Just found out today that you can use Wine to run Windows apps on Linux

2/Jan/25
  I didn't do anything today, my laptop charger gave me more problems.

3/Jan/25
  I didn't do anything today because I went out today.

4/Jan/25
  I did a lot of work today from 12 am to 4 am but didn't commit changes to my work because my system crashed. Just 
finish fixing it.

7/Jan/25
  I couldn't do anything today because of NYSC registration.

8/Jan/25
  I still couldn't do anything because of my NYSC registration.

9/Jan/25
  I'm still working on my registration.

10/Jan/25
  I couldn't do much today, it was a good day. I completed my NYSC registration just in time before the portal closed, and I also got a new PC. Now, I can start pushing more for my pen-testing career with a better tool.

11/Jan/25
  I couldn't do any projects today because I was setting up my PC and didn't have a Kali.

13/Jan/25
  I tried installing Kali as my default OS but couldn't. Now, I'm waiting to increase my ROM so I have more space to do everything, but I'll focus on sharpening my Python skills for now.

14/Jan/25
  I have already taken a Python crash course to revise. From there, I will start building Python projects.

15/Jan/25
  I've started the Python crash course.

16/Jan/25
  There is no internet today.

17/Jan/25
  Today I did some Python tests. I asked ChatGPT to give me some questions on the things I've learned and I did well getting 90%

18/Jan/25
  Today, I completed more Python tests, which I requested from ChatGPT. I prefer applying to learning alone.

19/Jan/25
  Instead of just doing a test today, I built something and took the day off. I built a calculator, and I'll start adding more features over time. I later updated the calculator code to add more features. I also created a password strength checker to be added to my cyber security Python projects.

20/Jan/25
  Today, I did some research about blockchain security engineering and Smart contract auditing, and I think I'm in love because damn. I'll keep you guys updated about the journey.

21/Jan/25
  So it's 12:30 am and I was working on some Python scripts. I started yesterday, so that means I wasn't yeah I worked yesterday and today, lol. It's 11 pm over here and I did more Python scripts. Writing big projects very soon.

22/Jan/25
  I did more revising on my Python. Among all the things I forgot, the for loop and while loop gave me a serious problem today, but I've gotten a hang of them.

23/Jan/25
  My Chrome browsers might be bugged because I can access Github, but the website doesn't respond well on my Chrome browser, but it does on other browsers. Now, back to what I did today: I did the usual: I learned Python and spoke about Web3 and blockchain security to some people to get ideas from them because they are in the Web3 space.

24/Jan/25
  Today, I ran into a problem and found out about Stackoverflow, so I'll be using there to get the solution to my Python problems.

25/Jan/25
  I tried fixing some codes on leet code and damn those are some serious problems. I will try and solve some of them and then continue learning.
 I also edited my GitHub profile and all my online profiles. Now, I want to return to the Python tutorial.

 27/Jan/25
   I missed yesterday because I was busy. I did a lot of work and taught a friend Python, the ones I knew. By the time I was done, it was after 12, so that was why I missed yesterday.

28/Jan/25
  Today I watched some Python questions and tried to strengthen my weaknesses. I had some problems but I've been able to fix that. Now I want to rest but I'm downloading something for my PC. So idk...I want to try building a new portfolio website for myself

31/Jan/25
  Noticed a significant drop in productivity and burnout so I stayed off everything for a while. Also stayed off GitHub because if I did log in I'm doing something so yeah. I'd be taking a week's break though.

4/Feb/25
  I just did some Python revision, so yeah, there's not much to report today. I just wanted to refresh my memory of Python.

18/Feb/25
  Didn't give much update for the past 2 weeks but a lot has been achieved. I got 2 different Internship from one started this month and is ending next month, the other is starting next month and is ending in the next one year(both in cybersecurity). So these were big steps for me. On my first week in my first intern, i was given a project to start with and i was supposed to submit a report too, the report was about HTML injection and Cross site scripting. I submitted and it got approved. I've been given another project for week 2 which i'm about to start with.
